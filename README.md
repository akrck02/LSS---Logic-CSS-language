# LSS - Logic Style Sheets

Imagine creating CSS with your favorite programming language. <br>
No. I'm not talking about **inline CSS**, I'm talking about **CSS files.** <br>

This library is SIMPLE.<br>
> _Create element / class / theme_.<br>
> _Set variables_. <br>
> _Set actions and settings_. <br>
> _Compile._

## Creating frameworks programmatically.
> Creating UI with object oriented programming (OOP) just makes sense.<br>

### Wanna make a component inherit some attributes? 
> Just extend the parent class!</span>

### Wanna make different themes for ur app? 
> Reassign variables with different values.

### Load speed âœ¨
> LSS creates a minified version of CSS in just **one file**.<br>

## Supported languages 
 - `Java (Core / Client)`
 - `Javascript (Client)`
 - `Typescript (Client)`
